# 4dots's Office EXE Unpacker (7 in 1) - Rewritten

To access the old version of the application, please go to the `old` branch

this should still work for the following unpackers (if they don't work with the rewritten version, the old one should still be able to unpack them)
<pre>
- Excel To EXE Converter
- Powerpoint To EXE Converter
- Word To EXE Converter
- PDF To EXE Converter
- ZIP Self Extractor Maker (might not work yet, use the old version of the unpacker instead)
- Standalone EXE Locker
- EXE Slideshow Maker
</pre>
